Instructions:
------------

Specification of requirements: The user will specify a problem or task. It is expected that the user will require an artifical intelligence model and implementation using python and pytorch. The agent will generate source code for pytorch taking into account the constraints specified below. The user will review the generated source code, refine and specify any further adjustments required.

Document the source code, functions, and their parameters. The documentation must be in the user's language unless the user specifies otherwise. 

Please create additional code for loading and saving the complete AI model, as well as separate parts of the model.

Please use pytorch and its types as much as possible. Please use GPU acceleration, if available. Please avoid using non-pytorch types in calculationss, since pytorch needs to calculate the gradient and the direction of descent.

Please generate some code for training the model and for loading training samples. Both possibilities shall be supported: loading all training data into memory (implies training from memory) and loading training data from disk.
